## About
I’m junior JS dev who is currently looking for new opportunities. I’m passionate about software development and web technologies.

For now, I want to improve my current knowledge and learn a lot of new things, from both frontend and backend sides. I love to learn new things, whether it's about computer science or about travel, economics, etc. I believe that a person should constantly explore the world around them and always need to learn something new.

Although I don't have a lot of commercial experience, I have much more valuable qualities - curiosity and strong desire to learn. I hope I can grow up with you as a professional.
